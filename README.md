# Pen-and-Paper

This is a collection of pen and paper stories.
All stories are designed by me to be independent of the actual game you play (e.g. DnD, DSA, etc).
Thus, they are not completely ready to play but you have to finalize the characters according to the rules of your game.

I try to prepare all stories in german and in english.
